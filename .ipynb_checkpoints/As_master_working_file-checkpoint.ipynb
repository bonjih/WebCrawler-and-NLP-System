    "<font size=\"3\"> The majority of wine drinkers are not experts. Most buy wine by price, label type and reputation (aka marketing) [1]. To buy a wine without being disappointed, one would require a trial an error approach, record metadata for each bottle, for example, price, grape, blend, region, country etc, and do not forget the wine drinkers descriptives such as 'a subtle hint of chocolate'. This would take considerable effort, expense, and discipline. What if chance could be taken out of buying wine, the change of being disappointed is better than 51%?<br><br>This project compares wine reviews and sentiment from wine experts and the average wine drinker, aka wine plebs. The project goal uses NLP to produce a review that is a balance between the expert and the average wine drinker. To achieve this goal, a WebCrawler takes a wine list from a popular Australian website, nicks.com.au. This website was chosen due to large number of wine items available. The wine items chosen are red wines between \\\\$15&ndash;\\$40, mainly to reduce the wine list, however, this price range will be typlical for the non-wine expert. Another WebCrawler is used to find wine reviews from the experts and non-experts. Natural Language Processing sentiment analysis is used fine key words within each review, these words sentiment are then used to create a new review. This new review is a complementary decision maker for the average wine drinker that removes the impact of label type and reputation from the purchase.</font>\n",
