 <h2 align="center">An expert and non-wine expert review comparison</h2>

<font size="3">Wine reviews generally come in two varieties, reviews from wine experts and a non-expert. Wine experts describe wine in a unique way, they use strong nouns and adjectives to convey how the wine tastes, its drinkability, compatibility with types of food etc. They use words such as, ‘bold’ and ‘strong’ to indicate weight and feel, and ‘brawny’ for big, masculine wines, and ‘finesse’ indicating the wines elegance. In contrast, non-wine experts’ tent to use weak nouns and adjectives, such as ‘good’ and nice, or phrases like ‘goes well with steak’. For non-wine experts, both descriptions are not helpful when deciding to but a bottle. There must be a middle ground.

This prototype wine review comparison attempts to analyse reviews from thousands of wines (red wines between $15-$40), from wine experts and non-experts. Then, employ an NLP solution to get a deeper understanding of reviews, compare them to each other, and discover if it is possible to write a new review that takes the middle ground. The intent is therefore to have a wine review a non-wine expert can use to buy wine to their liking, the first time (a new wine review is future work).

This project scraps a 10,000 plus wine list with expert reviews/descriptions from a popular Australian wine retailer, and from another site, scrapes non-wine expert reviews using the same wine list. The WebCrawler also scrapes metadata for example price and vintage for use in future development. Research has shown that a $15 bottle can have a bad review over a $40 bottle, even though the wines are similar in quality. </font>
