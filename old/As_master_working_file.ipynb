    "<font size=\"3\"> The majority of wine drinkers are not experts. They mostly buy wine by price, label type and reputation (aka marketing)[1]. To buy a wine without being disappointed, one would require a trial an error approach, record metadata for each bottle, for example, price, grape, blend, region, country etc, and do not forget the wine drinkers descriptives such as 'a subtle hint of chocolate'. This would take considerable effort, expense, and discipline. Moreover, non-wine experts do n0t use strong adjectives, nouns, and verbs. What if chance could be taken out of buying wine, the chance of being disappointed is better than 51%?<br><br>This project compares wine reviews from wine experts and the average wine drinker (aka community reviews). The project goal is to use NLP to compare both the expert and non-expert reviews and see if it is possible to tell the difference. These differences can be used in future work to produce a balanced and more realistic review, so that the average wine drinker can understand, and hopeful chose to buy or not to buy the wine. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal, a WebCrawler takes a wine list from a popular Australian website, nicks.com.au. This website was chosen due to large number of wines available. The wine items chosen are red wines between \\\\$15&ndash;\\$40, mainly to reduce the wine list, however, this price range will be the typical purchase price for the non-wine expert. Another WebCrawler is used to find wine reviews from the non-wine experts. Natural Language Processing analysis is used fine key words within each review, these words are then used to predict if a review is from and expert or not. The results can be used for a new review, and used to  complement the buying decision. It will help the average wine drinker by removing the impact of label type, price and reputation from the purchase.\n",

    "<font size=\"3\">This programme consumes data from two wine websites, nicks.com.au and vivino.com. From the nicks.com.au site, 10,080 wine items are scraped with their expert reviews/descriptions. From vivino.com, the non-expert wine reviews are scrapped using the wine list from nicks.com.au. In addition to the community reviews, their averaged wine rating is also acquired. These two sites were used due to there being a large inventory of wines and reviews. Wines between \\\\$15&ndash;\\$40 are selected, firstly to reduce scrapping time and secondly, this price bracket is assumed a typical price range for most people. In principle, thousands of wines can be scraped.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data extracted from nicks.com.au site is wine vintage (year), wine name, price, and description/review. The price is per bottle and the description/review are expert reviews describing the wine using expert wine words, for example wine 2019 30 Mile Shiraz, ‘*Fresh and inky the nose tosses up a mix of crushed berries, plum and liquorice followed by subtle spicy oak and pepper notes*’. The data extracted from vivino.com are the corresponding non-expert wine review. Using wine example 2019 30 Mile Shiraz, a non-expert wine review is ‘*At Brittany’s bachelorette night on Salt spring. It’s the kind of red I like.*’, and ‘*Easy drinking with full meals*’. Site vivino.com has multiple wine reviews.</font> \n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=\"3\">The nicks.com.au was relatively easily to scrape as the site has an option to show the wines in list form. This meant only having to iterate through the list under class name ‘*info*’ and extracting the relevant elements. A top to bottom scrap was made just in case content was loaded when the paged is scrolled. Site vivino.com was more difficult for two reasons, firstly, the pages load dynamically, i.e., only when slowly scrolling down the page, content is loaded. Secondly, to extract more than three reviews, a popup window had to be scrapped. The overcome the dynamic page loading problem, a slow scroller function is used to slowly scroll down the page. The slow scroll function goes down to the bottom, then back up to where the reviews are shown. It took considerable time to find the balance between the speed of the scroller and making sure the content is loaded. Another function is used to check the existence of the xpath/id etc being used. If the path does not exist, scrape without popup (generally only three reviews, or none). Certain implicit wait and sleep times were used to ensure wine names were inserted in the search bar and content loaded. \n",
    " \n",
    "The vivino.com site under ‘Terms of Use’, indicates content can be used for non-commercial use only. The data cannot be licensed, soled, rented, transferred etc. The nicks.com.au site is more liberal and nonspecific with regards to data use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metadata used in the project is price per bottle. As per [1], it is assumed that people buy wine on price, therefore where performing NLP analysis, price is taken into consideration to reduce potential bias.  The content extractor exported those elements required to achieve the objective, being vintage, wine name, price and the reviews from wine experts and non-experts. The final data structure is a single csv file which NLP will perform the analysis.</font>"

    "Due to the nature of wine descriptions, albeit from non-wine experts and experts, all use specific words, to describe wine. As mentioned in document 2, wine experts tend to use more frequently strong nouns and adjectives, where non wine experts use week nouns and adjectives. This being the case, the decision tree approach using a Bag-of-Words (BoW) is appropriate, i.e., utilised for training purposes[2]. Decision trees are widely used supervised machine learning algorithm [3], they are simple to understand, interpretable, and requires minimal data preparation for example, no data normalisation [4]. Due to the large dataset, a decision tree is able to analyse in a short period of time when compare to other techniques such SVM. Th dataset used is not ten's of thousands of lines, however there ten's of thousands of wines, in princple can be analysed. A decision tree breaks down the dataset into smaller subdivisions known as internal nodes and leaf nodes. The leaf node is the type of node that contains a classification (label)[5]. For this analisys, words contained with the BoW's will be used for the decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The an 'online addiction recovery forums' study, where posted messages are moderated to detect risk , moderators spend many hours reading hundereds of messages, very time consummng[6]. Their paper looked at three classifiers SVM, decision tree and boosten decision tree, using, Bag-of-Words, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and a Hybrid (using the most important features from the other three classifiers). According to [6], and anlaysing 2581 messages, their study found that 'SVM performed worst with improvements in decision trees and best performance in boosted decision trees where we achieved F-scores of 0.88, 0.89, and 0.94 for the BoW, LIWC, and hybrid approaches, respectively'[Kornfield et a, 2018, p. 6). Boosted decision trees using the hybrid approch looked to perfor the best. </font>\n"
