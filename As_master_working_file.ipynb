    "<font size=\"3\"> The majority of wine drinkers are not experts. Most buy wine by price, label type and reputation (aka marketing) [1]. To buy a wine without being disappointed, one would require a trial an error approach, record metadata for each bottle, for example, price, grape, blend, region, country etc, and do not forget the wine drinkers descriptives such as 'a subtle hint of chocolate'. This would take considerable effort, expense, and discipline. What if chance could be taken out of buying wine, the change of being disappointed is better than 51%?<br><br>This project compares wine reviews and sentiment from wine experts and the average wine drinker, aka wine plebs. The project goal uses NLP to produce a review that is a balance between the expert and the average wine drinker. To achieve this goal, a WebCrawler takes a wine list from a popular Australian website, nicks.com.au. This website was chosen due to large number of wine items available. The wine items chosen are red wines between \\\\$15&ndash;\\$40, mainly to reduce the wine list, however, this price range will be typlical for the non-wine expert. Another WebCrawler is used to find wine reviews from the experts and non-experts. Natural Language Processing sentiment analysis is used fine key words within each review, these words sentiment are then used to create a new review. This new review is a complementary decision maker for the average wine drinker that removes the impact of label type and reputation from the purchase.</font>\n",

    "<font size=\"3\">This programme consumes data from two wine websites, nicks.com.au and vivino.com. From the nicks.com.au site, 10,080 wine items are scraped with their expert reviews/descriptions. From vivino.com, the non-expert wine reviews are scrapped using the wine list from nicks.com.au. These two sites were used due to there being a large inventory of wines and reviews. Wines between \\\\$15&ndash;\\$40 are selected, firstly to reduce scrapping time and secondly, this price bracket is assumed a typical price range for most people. In principle, thousands of wines can be scraped.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data extracted from nicks.com.au site is wine vintage (year), wine name, price, and description/review. The price is per bottle and the description/review are expert reviews describing the wine using expert wine words, for example wine 2019 30 Mile Shiraz, ‘Fresh and inky the nose tosses up a mix of crushed berries, plum and liquorice followed by subtle spicy oak and pepper notes’. The data extracted from vivino.com are the corresponding non-expert wine review. Using wine example 2019 30 Mile Shiraz, a non-expert wine review is ‘At Brittany’s bachelorette night on Salt spring. It’s the kind of red I like.’, and ‘Easy drinking with full meals’. Site vivino.com has multiple wine reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nicks.com.au was relatively easily to scrape as the site has an option to show the wines in list form. This meant only having to iterate through the list under class name ‘info’ and extracting the relevant elements. Site vivino.com was more difficult for two reasons, firstly, the pages load dynamically, i.e., only when slowly scrolling down the page, content is loaded. Secondly, to extract more than three reviews, a popup window had to be scrapped. The overcome the dynamic page loading problem, a slow scroller function is used to slowly scroll down the page. It took considerable time to find the balance between the speed of the scroller and making sure the content is loaded. Another function is used to check the existence of the xpath/id etc being used. If the path does not exist, scrape without popup. Certain implicit wait and sleep times were used to ensure wine names were inserted in the search bar and content loaded. \n",
    " \n",
    "The vivino.com site under ‘Terms of Use’, indicates content can be used for non-commercial use only. The data cannot be licensed, soled, rented, transferred etc. The nicks.com.au site is more liberal and nonspecific with regards to data use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metadata used in the project is price per bottle. As per [1], it is assumed that people buy wine on price, therefore where performing NLP analysis, price is taken into consideration to reduce potential bias.  The content extractor exported those elements required to achieve the objective, being vintage, wine name, price and the reviews from wine experts and non-experts. The final data structure is a single csv file which NLP will perform the analysis\n",
